// Landlock LSM filesystem and network restrictions for Linux.
//
// Applied before seccomp (but after bwrap sets up the mount
// namespace) to restrict which paths the sandboxed process can
// read, write, and execute — even if bwrap's bind mounts expose
// them.
//
// THREAT MODEL
//
// bwrap provides mount-namespace isolation: only explicitly bound
// paths are visible inside the sandbox. Landlock adds a second,
// independent filesystem restriction layer that:
//
//  1. Survives mount-namespace escapes — if an attacker finds a
//     way to remount or move_mount (blocked by seccomp, but
//     defense-in-depth), Landlock still prevents access to paths
//     outside the allowed set.
//  2. Enforces read-only where bwrap uses ro-bind — Landlock's
//     VFS-level checks catch writes even through /proc/self/fd
//     or mmap(PROT_WRITE) on a read-only bind mount.
//  3. Restricts network (V4, kernel ≥ 6.7) — in lockdown mode,
//     denies all TCP bind/connect as defense-in-depth alongside
//     bwrap's --unshare-net.
//  4. Scopes abstract Unix sockets and signals (V6, kernel ≥ 6.12,
//     best-effort) — blocks connecting to abstract sockets created
//     outside the sandbox (e.g. the host's abstract X11 socket) and
//     signalling host processes. Below V6 this layer is absent, so the
//     backstop for those two classes then relies on bwrap's namespaces
//     (the private netns fences abstract sockets whenever network is
//     off); the pathname user bus is always a mount-namespace concern,
//     not a Landlock one.
//
// Path selection philosophy:
//  - System dirs (/usr, /etc, /opt, …) are read-only: agents
//    need compilers and libraries but must not modify them.
//  - /proc is read-write: bwrap writes /proc/self/uid_map
//    during namespace setup. Individual /proc files are further
//    restricted by the kernel's own permission checks.
//  - /dev is read-write: bwrap creates a minimal private /dev
//    (null, zero, random, urandom, tty). GPU passthrough needs
//    write access to /dev/nvidia* and /dev/dri/*.
//  - /tmp is read-write: language runtimes and build tools
//    create temporary files here.
//  - $HOME is a tmpfs: Landlock allows writes because the real
//    home is hidden; individual dotdirs are bind-mounted ro/rw
//    by bwrap (Landlock defers to the stricter of the two).
//  - Project dir is read-write (normal) or read-only (lockdown):
//    the primary work directory for the AI agent.
//  - In lockdown mode, the allowed set is minimal: system ro,
//    /proc + /dev + /tmp rw, project ro. No $HOME, no dotdirs,
//    no Docker, no GPU, no display.
