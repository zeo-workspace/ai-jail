# ai-jail — Development Guidelines

## What This Project Is

A Rust CLI tool that wraps bubblewrap (`bwrap`) to sandbox AI coding agents (Claude Code, GPT Codex, OpenCode, Crush). It replaces a bash script with config persistence (`.ai-jail` TOML), proper signal handling, and a developer-friendly CLI.

ai-jail is a developer-friendly accident guard, not a hard-security or malware/invasion boundary. It defends against a trusted-but-fallible agent's mistakes (a mistyped command that deletes files outside the project, a wayward script) so the project directory is a confident blast radius for "YOLO mode" auto-accept harnesses — it does not defend against a motivated attacker trying to escape the sandbox. That is why dev tools and the invoked agent's own credentials are on by default, with flags to progressively tighten; for genuinely hostile code or untrusted workloads, the answer is a disposable VM, not a stricter ai-jail flag. Keep this framing in mind when weighing a new default: tightening security at the cost of developer convenience is not automatically the right call here.

## Critical Rule: Backward Compatibility

**Every new version MUST work with previously generated `.ai-jail` config files.**

This is the single most important invariant of the project. Users generate `.ai-jail` files in their project directories and expect them to keep working after upgrading the binary.

### Config file rules

- **Never remove a config field.** If a field becomes obsolete, keep deserializing it but ignore its value. Use `#[serde(default)]` on all fields so missing fields get defaults.
- **Never rename a config field.** If a better name is needed, add the new name and keep the old one as an alias (`#[serde(alias = "old_name")]`).
- **Never change a field's type.** A `Vec<String>` must stay a `Vec<String>`. If richer types are needed, add a new field.
- **New fields must have defaults.** Always use `#[serde(default)]` so old config files without the field still parse.
- **Unknown fields must be silently ignored.** Never use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. This allows old configs with removed fields to still load.
- When writing config files, only serialize fields that differ from defaults (keeps files clean for users who edit them by hand).

### CLI option rules

- **Never remove a CLI flag.** If a flag becomes obsolete, keep accepting it silently (with an optional deprecation warning to stderr).
- **Never change the meaning of an existing flag.** `--no-gpu` must always mean "disable GPU passthrough".
- **New flags must not break existing invocations.** Defaults for new flags must preserve the prior behavior.
- **Positional command behavior is sacred.** `ai-jail claude` must always mean "run claude inside the sandbox".

### Security defaults and config authority

- Private home is on by default. Command-specific state may be supplied by
  global config; broad home exposure requires explicit `--no-private-home`.
- Network, GPU, display, X11, host shared memory, terminal passthrough, macOS
  host IPC, and worktree metadata are opt-in. Do not weaken these defaults.
- Network is the one default with a built-in exception: when dev-toolchain
  support is enabled (the default) and neither `--network` nor
  `--no-network` is set, ai-jail default-allows filtered egress to a fixed
  list of package-registry hosts (`TOOLCHAIN_REGISTRY_HOSTS` in
  `sandbox/mod.rs`) so dependency fetches work out of the box. This is gated
  on an unprivileged network-namespace probe (`unprivileged_netns_available`)
  that falls back to fully offline when unavailable, never to unrestricted
  access. `--no-network` always forces strict offline regardless.
- Dev-toolchain cache persistence (`--toolchains`/`no_toolchains`, on by
  default) and the opt-in read-only credential flags (`--github`, `--aws`,
  `--kube`, `--gcloud`, `--docker-config`) are monotonic capabilities: a
  project `.ai-jail` may only disable them, never enable them, and all are
  disabled under `--lockdown`.
- Project `.ai-jail` is untrusted monotonic policy. It may tighten the effective
  sandbox but cannot enable capabilities, outside maps, ports, `claude_dir`, or
  exceptions. Capability opt-ins belong in global config or on the CLI.
  The single exception is `trust_project_config` in the _global_ config, which
  names directories whose project files are merged with trusted semantics. The
  trust always originates in the trusted layer: a project file that sets
  `trust_project_config` itself is ignored and warned about.
- Existing malformed config, bootstrap/wrapper setup, and overlay setup must
  fail closed. Bootstrap files must remain mode `0600`.

### Testing backward compatibility

There are regression tests in `src/config.rs` that parse old config file formats. **When changing config.rs, always add a new regression test with the old format before making changes.** Never delete existing regression tests.

## Coding Conventions

- **No async, no tokio.** This is a synchronous CLI tool.
- **Minimal dependencies.** Current deps: `lexopt`, `serde`, `toml`, `serde_json`, `vt100`, `nix`, `landlock`, `seccompiler` (Linux). Do not add new crates without a strong justification.
- **No clap.** We use `lexopt` for argument parsing to keep the binary small.
- **Raw ANSI for colors.** No color crate — `output.rs` handles this with raw escape codes.
- **Warn and skip, never crash.** Missing paths, unreadable dirs, and non-critical errors produce a warning and continue. Existing `.ai-jail` files that cannot be read or parsed are fatal because silently dropping sandbox policy would fail open. Other fatal errors include no bwrap and an unavailable current directory.
- **Signal safety.** The signal handler (`signals.rs`) must only use async-signal-safe operations. The current handler just calls `libc::kill` on the stored child PID.
- **RAII for cleanup.** Temp files use a `Drop` guard, not manual cleanup.

## Mount Order Matters

The bwrap command mounts are order-dependent. The sequence in `sandbox/bwrap.rs` must be:

1. Base mounts (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/proc`, `/tmp`, `/run`)
2. Sensitive /sys masks (tmpfs over `/sys/firmware`, `/sys/kernel/security`, etc.)
3. GPU devices, then KVM device (`--kvm`, `/dev/kvm`)
4. Docker socket
5. Tailscale socket
6. Shared memory (`/dev/shm`)
7. Display mounts (validated Wayland socket and optional X11; never the whole runtime directory)
8. Audio mounts (`--audio`: validated PipeWire/PulseAudio sockets in the runtime dir, plus `/dev/snd`)
9. systemd user bus mounts (`--systemd-user`, narrow explicit runtime sockets)
10. Home directory (tmpfs `$HOME` first, then command-specific state/dotfiles)
11. Config hide (tmpfs over sensitive `~/.config/*` subdirs)
12. Cache hide (tmpfs over sensitive `~/.cache/*` subdirs)
13. Local overrides (`~/.local/state`, `~/.local/share/*` rw subdirs)
14. Command binary exemption (paths the sandbox would otherwise hide: under private home the command's own directory beneath `$HOME`, and always the NixOS system profile under the private `/run`; under private home, symlink hops of the command chain are recreated with `--symlink` using the verbatim host target text so symlink-following heuristics keep working — bun locates its app root via `package.json` in the dirname of the invoked executable, which a flattened `--ro-bind` broke (prime-agent ENOENT `package.json`) — and only the terminal real path is `--ro-bind`ed)
15. Linked Git worktree metadata (validated, opt-in; common dir mounted first, then the nested per-worktree git dir — both writable outside lockdown, both read-only under it)
16. SSH agent socket and `~/.ssh` exemption mounts
17. Pictures mount
18. Browser profile state mount
19. Extra user mounts (`--map`, `--rw-map`; sorted parent-first by destination depth, so a read-only map that is a direct child of a read-write map lands on top of it; deeper, missing or symlinked children make the read-write parent refused)
20. Overlay maps (`--overlay-map` — copy-on-write `--overlay-src`/`--overlay`)
21. Project directory (pwd, rw or ro depending on mode)
22. In-project user mounts (after the project bind)
23. In-project overlay maps (after the project bind)
24. Mask overlays (`--mask` and hidden project `.ai-jail`)
25. Deny overlays (`--deny-path`, mode-000 file/dir placeholders)
26. Overlay storage hide (tmpfs over `<project>/.ai-jail-overlays`, last of the discovered groups)
27. Landlock wrapper self-mount and filtered-egress proxy socket (emitted after all discovered groups so the `/tmp` tmpfs already exists: ai-jail itself read-only at `/tmp/.ai-jail-landlock`, and in filtered mode a writable bind of the outer proxy's Unix socket to `/tmp/.ai-jail-proxy.sock` — only the socket file, never its temp dir — and one writable bind per `--forward-port` of its host-side Unix socket to `/tmp/.ai-jail-forward.<port>.sock`)

Changing this order can break the sandbox. The tmpfs for `$HOME` must come before the individual dotfile bind mounts. Overlay maps come after the home/dotfile mounts (so an overlay on a home path sits on top). User mounts and overlay maps whose destination sits **inside** the project directory are emitted after the project mount — bwrap gives the later mount precedence, so emitting them earlier lets the project bind silently shadow them (issue #83: `--map .git` stayed writable and in-project overlay writes hit the real files). Mask and deny overlays come after those so they still win. Overlay storage hide comes last among the discovered groups, after the project mount, so it masks the upper/work layers the project mount would otherwise expose. Group 27 is emitted programmatically at the end of `build`/`dry_run`, not discovered with the rest: all its members must sit on top of the `/tmp` tmpfs from group 1.

## Before Committing

Always run `cargo fmt` before committing. CI enforces `cargo fmt --check` and will fail on unformatted code. The project uses `max_width = 80` via `rustfmt.toml`.

```
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

## Running Tests

```
cargo test
```

Tests are in `#[cfg(test)]` modules at the bottom of each source file. Config tests use `tempfile`-style patterns with `std::env::temp_dir()`.

## Building

```
cargo build --release    # 881K stripped binary
```

Install by copying `target/release/ai-jail` to `~/.local/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`.

## Releasing

Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, run `cargo update -p ai-jail`, add
`releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, commit as `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, then tag and push:

```
git tag -m vX.Y.Z vX.Y.Z    # tag.gpgSign=true is set repo-local: -m is required
git push origin master vX.Y.Z
```

The repo sets `tag.gpgSign = true` and a local `user.signingkey`, so release
tags are annotated and GPG-signed. Always pass `-m`: without it git opens an
editor for the tag message, which hangs non-interactive shells.
